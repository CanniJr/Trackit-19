# This app tracks Covid-19 cases

My final project from Flatiron School utilizes Leaflet.js to render a map with it's additional features. This is an attempt to further improve on what I will use using the same library.

## What I use for the app:
- Material UI
- Firebase Google

## API
- disease.sh
