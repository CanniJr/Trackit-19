# This app tracks Covid-19 cases

My final project from Flatiron School utilizes Leaflet.js to render a map with it's additional features. This is an attempt to further improve on what I will use using the same library.

## What I use for the app:
- Material UI
- Firebase Google
- Numeral
- React-Chart
- Leaflet.js
- React-Leaflet
    * an update in the react-leaflet library changes how we set state and re-render the immutable MapContainer. Used the provided useMap() hook from react-leaflet for it to function.
